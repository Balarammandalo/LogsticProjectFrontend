## ⚠️ Map Not Showing? Here's the Fix!

The Google Map requires an API key to work. Follow these 3 simple steps:

## 🚀 3-Step Setup

### Step 1️⃣: Get Your API Key (5 minutes)

1. Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/
2. Create a project (or use existing)
3. Click **"Enable APIs and Services"**
4. Enable these 4 APIs:
   - ✅ Maps JavaScript API
   - ✅ Geocoding API
   - ✅ Distance Matrix API
   - ✅ Places API
5. Go to **Credentials** → **Create Credentials** → **API Key**
6. **Copy the API key** (looks like: `AIzaSyXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX`)

### Step 2️⃣: Add API Key (30 seconds)

1. Open the file: `frontend/.env`
2. Replace the empty value with your API key:
   ```env
   REACT_APP_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=AIzaSyXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
   ```
3. Save the file

### Step 3️⃣: Restart Server (10 seconds)

```bash
# Stop the server: Press Ctrl+C
# Start again:
npm start
```

## ✅ That's It!

The map should now load properly. You'll see:
- 🗺️ Interactive Google Map centered on India
- 🟢 Green marker for pickup location
- 🔴 Red marker for drop location
- 📏 Distance and time calculation
- 🛣️ Route line between locations

## 🎯 What If I Don't Have an API Key Yet?

**No problem!** The app will show you helpful setup instructions right in the booking page. You can:
1. See the instructions
2. Follow the steps
3. Come back and add the key later

The rest of the app works fine without the map!

## 💡 Quick Tips

### Free Tier
Google gives you **$200 free credit per month**. This covers:
- ~40,000 map loads
- ~40,000 address lookups
- ~40,000 distance calculations

**Perfect for development and small apps!**

### Security
- ✅ API key is in `.env` file (not in code)
- ✅ `.env` is in `.gitignore` (won't be committed)
- ✅ Safe to use in development

### For Production
When deploying to production:
1. Add API key to your hosting platform's environment variables
2. Restrict the API key to your domain
3. Set up billing alerts
