   - Professional landing page with hero section
   - Statistics showcase
   - Features grid
   - Call-to-action section
   - Footer

4. **Created Theme CSS** (`src/styles/theme.css`)
   - CSS custom properties for light/dark themes
   - Smooth transitions

5. **Updated App.js**
   - Added `CustomThemeProvider` wrapper
   - Set HomeDashboard as default route (`/`)
   - Removed redirect to `/login`
   - Added `/home` route

6. **Updated index.css**
   - Changed from fixed gradient to theme variables

## How to Test

```bash
# Make sure you're in the frontend directory
cd frontend

# Start the development server
npm start
```

## What You'll See

When you run `npm start`, the app will now:

âœ… **Open at `http://localhost:3000`**  
âœ… **Display the Home Dashboard by default** (NOT the login page)  
âœ… **Show the TrackMate navbar** with all menu items  
âœ… **Have a working theme toggle** (sun/moon icon in top-right)  
âœ… **Display hero section** with welcome message  
âœ… **Show statistics** (15K+ vehicles, 800K+ deliveries, etc.)  
âœ… **Display features grid** with 6 key features  

## Navigation

- **TrackMate Logo** â†’ Returns to Home Dashboard
- **About Us, Services, Contact** â†’ Placeholder pages (can be created later)
- **Explore Dropdown** â†’ Careers, Documentation, API Reference, Blog
- **Theme Toggle** â†’ Switch between light and dark mode
- **Login Button** â†’ Goes to `/login` (your existing login page)
- **Signup Button** â†’ Goes to `/register` (your existing register page)

## The Bug is Fixed! ðŸŽ‰

**Before:** App redirected to `/login` on startup  
**After:** App shows Home Dashboard on startup

The routes are now:
- `/` â†’ Home Dashboard âœ…
- `/home` â†’ Home Dashboard âœ…
- `/login` â†’ Login page (still works)
- `/register` â†’ Register page (still works)
- All other routes â†’ Redirect to Home Dashboard

## Theme Toggle

Click the sun/moon toggle in the navbar to switch between:
- **Light Mode** (default) - White backgrounds, dark text
- **Dark Mode** - Dark backgrounds, light text

Your preference is saved automatically!

## Next Steps (Optional)

If you want to add the other pages (About Us, Services, etc.), they can be created later. For now, the Home Dashboard is fully functional and displays by default.

Enjoy your new Home Dashboard! ðŸš€
