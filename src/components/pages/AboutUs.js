          <p className="story-text">
            Founded in 2020, TrackMate was born from a simple observation: logistics companies 
            were struggling with outdated tracking systems and inefficient route planning. Our 
            founders, experienced logistics professionals and tech innovators, came together to 
            create a solution that would revolutionize the industry.
          </p>
          <p className="story-text">
            Today, TrackMate serves thousands of businesses worldwide, from small local delivery 
            services to large international logistics corporations. Our platform has processed 
            millions of deliveries, saved countless hours of planning time, and helped reduce 
            carbon emissions through optimized routing.
